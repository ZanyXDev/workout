Workout::Chunk - Workout Data Chunk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $chunk = Workout::Chunk->new( 
  	time	=> scalar time(),
	dur	=> 5,
	work	=> 100,
	# ... other core fields
  );
  print join(' ', $chunk->stime, $chunk->dur, $chunk->time, $chunk->pwr ),"\n";

  $mem = Workout::Store->new;
  $mem->chunk_add( $chunk );

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new( [ \%arg ] )

creates new chunk. Fills in data from \%arg.

=head2 $copy = $chunk->clone( [ \%overrides ] )

copy current chunk.

=cut

sub clone {
	my( $self, $a ) = @_;

	$a ||= {};
	Workout::Chunk->new( { 
		%$self,
		%$a,
	});
}

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 core_fields

returns list with all core fields.

=cut

sub core_fields {
	@core_fields;
}


=head1 CORE FIELDS

These are the fields with actual data. Other fields in this chunk are
calculated from these fields. The accessor methods allow set/get of the
values. You can pass these fields to the constructor for initialization.

=head2 time	I<abs>

Chunk end date in seconds (sec) since epoch 1970-1-1. Essential: Must be non-null in
each chunk.

=head2 dur	I<relative>

Duration / length of chunk in seconds (sec). Essential: Must be non-null in each
chunk.

=head2 ele	I<geo>

Elevation at end of interval in meter (m)

=head2 lon,lat	I<geo>

GPS coordinates degrees of arc WGS84 (°).

=head2 dist	I<relative>

travelled distance during chunk in meters (m).

=head2 cad	I<avg>

Average Cadence during chunk (1/min)

=head2 hr	I<avg>

Average Heartrate during chunk (1/mi)n

=head2 work	I<relative>

work done during this chunk (Joule)

=head2 temp	I<abs>

Temperature at end of chunk in degrees centigrade (°C)

=head2 prev

Not really a core field. Points to the previous chunk. This is necessary
for several of the following calculations.
